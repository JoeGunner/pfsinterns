				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<article>
					<p>My name is Matthew Floris, and I'm the owner of a basic blog posting website. 
					While design isn't my strongest skill, I always put in my best effort. 
					I dedicate most of my time to practicing and improving my skills, whether it's coding or gaming. 
					When I'm not honing my abilities, I enjoy learning new things. 
					I can be quite determined, sometimes even stubborn, when working on assignments or tasks, but I'm always open to discovering ways to improve and work more efficiently.
